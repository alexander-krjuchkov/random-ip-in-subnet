## Roadmap

* **Implement testing**  
    Testing is an essential part of developing a high-quality product.
    Despite the challenges of implementing tests for a library that works with random variables, testing should still be integrated into the library to improve reliability and correctness.

* **Improve documentation**  
    Documentation should clearly describe the functionality of the library and provide a clear understanding of its purpose and features.

* **Expand the roadmap**  
    Consider expanding the project roadmap to include additional goals and long-term plans for the library's development.
